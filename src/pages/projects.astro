          Here is a small sample of projects I have worked on. 
        </p>
        <p>    
          Many of these projects were written with Vue.js, 
          but I am also proficient with Web Components and I'm also familiar with React.
        </p>
        <p>I am already looking forward to grow the list significantly in the near future!</p>
