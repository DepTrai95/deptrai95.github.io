A very simple website in which I have learned using PrimeVue for the very first time. Using an UI-Library like PrimeVue has shown me how powerful these Tools are. The library provided ready-to-use components that significantly sped up the development process while maintaining a professional look and feel.

Using a Vite-powered Vue 3 this website is blazing fast and reaches top-scores on Googles Lighthouse.
