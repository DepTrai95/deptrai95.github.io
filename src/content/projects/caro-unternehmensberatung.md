A website relaunch of a well-established IT company specializing in DevOps and deployment services. While their previous focus was on large enterprises, the new website is designed to also appeal to small and mid-sized businesses.

To support their marketing efforts, all visible content is dynamically pulled from their HubSpot database—giving the client 
full control to update and manage content directly through HubSpot’s interface.

Although HubSpot offers a built-in WYSIWYG editor, the site was developed using Astro.js to allow for greater customization, performance, and flexibility.
