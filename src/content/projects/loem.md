Labor Order Entry Module (LOEM)

As the sole Frontend Developer on the project, I was responsible for the complete frontend architecture, implementation, and technical decision-making.

Developed a modern, fully digital Labor Order Entry Module (LOEM) that enables doctors and medical practices to create, manage, and archive laboratory orders efficiently and intuitively.

The frontend was designed and implemented with a strong focus on usability, performance, and scalability, providing a dynamic user interface for the digital creation of laboratory orders. Key features include drag-and-drop profile creation, intuitive analysis selection via mouse interaction, and a clear, structured workflow tailored to everyday clinical use.

The system supports automatic order number management and calculation of required label quantities, significantly reducing manual effort and potential errors. Integrated one-click printing functionality allows users to print blank forms and barcode labels directly from the application, streamlining laboratory and practice workflows.

An electronic archive was implemented to support both temporary and long-term storage of laboratory orders, ensuring traceability, reusability, and compliance with operational requirements.

From an architectural perspective, the solution consists of two separate applications:
-	a central hub used by the laboratory provider to manage customers and configurations
-	a dedicated frontend application for end users in medical practices

The frontend was built using Web Components, enabling a modular, reusable, and maintainable architecture while delivering a modern and responsive user experience for healthcare professionals.
