As the sole Frontend Developer on the project, I was responsible for the complete frontend architecture, implementation, and technical decision-making.

Developed a secure VPN router solution for medical practices and clinics, enabling compliant online communication, encrypted data transfer, electronic delivery of medical reports, and billing-related data exchange.

Designed and implemented a user-friendly multi-tab cockpit interface featuring real-time status indicators, activation and license management, and a centralized service overview to simplify daily operations for medical staff and administrators.

As part of a major modernization effort, two complex legacy React applications were fully rewritten and merged into a single solution based on Web Components. This architectural shift reduced dependency overhead, improved runtime performance, and lowered resource consumption, while increasing long-term maintainability and scalability.

The platform supports sending, receiving, signing, and managing KIM, KVC, email messages, e-doctor letters, SMS, and fax, as well as handling healthcare-specific billing and invoicing workflows such as OneClick, DALE-UV, ePVS, and eDMP. The result is a more efficient, user-friendly, and robust system that better serves both technical requirements and business needs in the healthcare sector.
