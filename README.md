# Portfolio Website

This is a Portfolio Website created using Astro.js with plain old good SCSS/CSS 

## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ favicon.svg
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Card.astro
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ layouts/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Layout.astro
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ pages/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ index.astro
â””â”€â”€ package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## Prerequisites
To build/run this project locally, nvm, npm and Node v18+ are required.

- If not already installed, install nvm on your machine from [here](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm). You can check whether nvm is installed in your terminal with `nvm -v`.
- If it is not already the standard-version - install Node v18 with `nvm install 18`. You can check whether the right Node version is selected with `node -v`. If a different Node version is selected, use `nvm use 18`.
- Navigate to the project folder in your terminal and install project dependencies with `npm install`.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
